## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. 📥 Data Collection  
- Extracted historical **Tesla** and **GameStop** stock prices using the `yfinance` library.  
- Scraped quarterly **revenue data** from MacroTrends using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- Transformed raw HTML tables into clean pandas DataFrames.  
- Ensured missing values and non-numeric data were removed for accuracy.

### 3. 📊 Visualization  
- Created side-by-side plots comparing stock prices with quarterly revenue data.  
- Used a custom `make_graph()` function to keep plots consistent, interactive, and visually appealing.

### 4. 📌 Final Output  
- Plots were exported and organized for use in a dashboard/report format.  
- Insights focus on financial growth patterns and market performance.
